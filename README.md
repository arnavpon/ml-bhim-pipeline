User Manual for Morey Lab (ML) - Bhim Pipeline

# Things to Note Pre-Installation
1. Go to your Docker desktop application and make sure the available RAM for Docker is set to **5 GB or more**.
   - The additional RAM is necessary for the MRtrix3 installation


2. The file is large and the download process takes a while. Please ensure that your computer doesnâ€™t fall asleep during the process.
   - If your computer falls asleep, certain large downloads may time out, causing the whole installation to fail


3. To download the image from Docker, use the command `docker pull arnavpon/moreylab-bhim-pipeline`

# Image Usage (Post-Installation)
1. Run the image with the command `docker run -it -v /my/data/directory:/pipeline/datadir ml-bhim-pipeline`

2. More information on the linked volume
   - The option/argument `-v /my/data/dir:/pipeline/datadir` creates a link between the **local** directory and a location on the image (`/pipeline/datadir`). Make sure that your fMRI data is present on this directory, and in the specified format (*see step 3*).
   - You **MUST** specify your local data directory **AS A FULL PATH**, **not** a relative path!
   - The pre-processing outputs will be present **inside** the folder for the subject whose data was used for pre-processing. When you terminate the container, this data *will still exist* so you can access it at your leisure.


3. Proper format for your **local** data directory
   - Your linked directory should contain 1 sub-folder for each subject for whom you have fMRI data
   - Within each subfolder, the system needs only a single file to do its job: `/subject_name/bold.nii.gz`
   - Please make sure the file is named `bold.nii.gz` or the system won't be able to locate it


4. To run the pre-processing script
   - Use tcsh to call the run.test script, providing it with a single subject name on each run. The subject name should **exactly** match the corresponding folder in your data directory.
   - **Example Usage**: `tcsh run.test subject`
   - All results of pre-processing will be written to a `subject.results` folder within the subject's folder. This folder will show up on your local machine, and *will* persist after terminating the container.
