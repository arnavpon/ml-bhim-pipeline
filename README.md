User Manual for Morey Lab (ML) - Bhim Pipeline

PRIOR TO PULLING THE IMAGE
1) Go to your Docker desktop application and make sure the available RAM for Docker is set to <b>5 GB or more</b>.
	 - The additional RAM is necessary for the MRtrix3 installation
2) The file is large and the download process takes a while. Please ensure that your computer doesnâ€™t fall asleep during the process.
   - If your computer falls asleep, certain large downloads may time out, causing the whole installation to fail
3) To download the image from Docker, use the command `docker pull arnavpon/moreylab-bhim-pipeline`

IMAGE USAGE (POST-INSTALLATION)
1) Run the image with the command `docker run -it -v /my/data/directory:/pipeline/datadir ml-bhim-pipeline`

2) More information on the linked volume
   - The option/argument `-v /my/data/dir:/pipeline/datadir` creates a link between the <b>local</b> directory and a location on the image (`/pipeline/datadir`). Make sure that your fMRI data is present on this directory, and in the specified format (<i>see step 3</i>).
	 - You <b>MUST</b> specify your local data directory <b>AS A FULL PATH</b>, <u>not</u> a relative path!
	 - The pre-processing outputs will be present <u>inside</u> the folder for the subject whose data was used for pre-processing. When you terminate the container, this data <i>will still exist</i> so you can access it at your leisure.

3) Proper format for your <b>local</b> data directory
	 - Your linked directory should contain 1 sub-folder for each subject for whom you have fMRI data
	 - Within each subfolder, the system needs only a single file to do its job: `/subject_name/bold.nii.gz`
	 - Please make sure the file is named `bold.nii.gz` or the system won't be able to locate it

4) To run the pre-processing script
	 - Use tcsh to call the run.test script, providing it with a single subject name on each run. The subject name should <u>exactly</u> match the corresponding folder in your data directory.
	- <b>Example Usage</b>: `tcsh run.test subject`
	- All results of pre-processing will be written to a subject.results folder within the subject folder. This folder will show up on your local machine, and will persist after terminating the container.
